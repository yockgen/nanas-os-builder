# Image Composer Tool - Global Configuration
# This file contains tool-level settings that apply across all image builds.
# Image-specific parameters should be defined in the image specification.

# Core tool settings
workers: 67
# Number of concurrent download workers (1-64, default: 8)
# Higher values speed up package downloads but consume more network/CPU resources
# Recommended: 8-16 for most systems, 20+ for high-bandwidth servers

cache_dir: "/var/cache/image-composer"   
# Package cache directory where downloaded RPMs/DEBs are stored (default: ./cache)
# This directory persists between builds for package reuse
# Should have sufficient space (typically 1-5GB depending on image size)

work_dir: "/tmp/image-composer"
# Working directory for build operations and image assembly (default: ./workspace)
# Contains temporary build artifacts, extracted packages, and final images
# Cleaned up after successful builds
# Requires substantial space during builds (2-10GB typical)

temp_dir: ""
# Temporary directory for short-lived files like GPG keys and metadata parsing
# Empty value uses system default (/tmp on Linux, %TEMP% on Windows)
# Used for: GPG verification files, decompressed metadata, parsing operations
# Files here are deleted within seconds/minutes of creation

# Logging configuration
logging:
  level: "info"
  # Log verbosity level (default: info)
  # - debug: Most verbose, shows all operations and data structures
  # - info:  Normal output, shows progress and important events  
  # - warn:  Only warnings and errors, minimal output
  # - error: Only errors, very quiet operation
