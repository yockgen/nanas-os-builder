# Image Composer Architecture

## Introduction

The image composer is intended to be a generic toolkit to build operating system
images from pre-built artifacts such as `rpm`, `deb` supporting a range of
common OS for the distributed edge. You can customize the content of the OS to
suit your specific needs based on the type of application and workloads. The
image composer will first be targeting to support:

1. Edge Microvisor Toolkit (EMT) 3.0
1. AzureLinux 3.0
1. WindRiver eLxr

The image composer generates the desired image based on a JSON input which
defines what the target distribution, version, packages and kernel to include
and can generate both immutable and mutable images supporting bare metal and
VM deployments with ISO installers, raw image files and VHD (Virtual Hard
Drive).

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram outlines the high level architectural breakdown of the
image composer ![Architecture Overview](assets/architecture.drawio.svg)

The host system should be running a validated and supported Linux distribution
such as Ubuntu 24.04. The image-composer implements all of the common business
logic which remains the same regardless of which distribution you are building
an image for. Providers exists for the supported Operating Systems with a
interface definition that each provider needs to implement to decouple
distribution specific functionality from the core and common business logic.

The image composer generates a `chroot` environment which is used for
the image composition and creation process which is isolated from the host
operating file system. Packages are fetched, with help from a provider, and
cached locally before the image is being created.

The image composer and its providers use several common `modules` across such
as logging, image creation tools for the supported output formats. Configuration
specific information for the supported distributions are held in a configuration
manifest that holds distribution specific information required to build an image.

## Operational Flow

The following flow illustrates the overall image composition flow.

## Detailed Design 

The following diagram depicts the list of ![SW entities and their relationships ](assets/components.drawio.svg) in composing user specified OS image.

The following table captures the SW entities and their functions.

| SW Component | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| CLI   | A commandline interface module that provides an interface enabling users to create desired OS images |
| OS Image Provider Interface | As described above |
| Debian Package Handler |  for downloading, caching and serving the packages as needed to the OS Image providers  |
| Debian Package Cache |  for storing and retrieving the downloaded debian packages in an efficient way  |
| RPM Package Handler |  for downloading, caching and serving the packages as needed to the OS Image providers  |
| RPM Package Cache |  for storing and retrieving the downloaded rpm packages in an efficient way  |
| Azure Linux Provider | for supporting creation of Azure Linux OS Images  |
| EMT Provider | for supporting creation of EMT OS Images  |
| Windriver LxR Provider |  for supporting creation of WindRiver LxR Images  |
| Chroot Environment |  for creation of chroot environment upon request, which would eventually be used to build the OS image|
| Boot Image Composer |  for creation of Boot Image upon request by the OS provider to bundle boot images with kernel images|
| Systemd-Boot Composer | for creation of Systemd-Boot Image upon request by the Boot Image Composer|
| ISO Maker | Converts an image in chroot environment into an ISO Image|
| Raw Maker | Converts an image in chroot environment into raw format|
| VHD Maker | Converts an image in chroot environment into VHD format|
| Image Store | Stores a limited set of images using LRU principle|
| Config Store | Stores Image Configuration Files for runtime reference and later use|
